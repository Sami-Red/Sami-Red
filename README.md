# 👋 Hi, I’m Sami

I'm a game developer with a degree in Game Development, recently graduated and actively building my portfolio. I focus on gameplay programming, prototyping, and networked systems using Unity and Unreal Engine. I enjoy working on mechanics that feel good to play, whether it’s tight movement, responsive combat, or immersive multiplayer systems.
I mostly work in **Unity (C#)** and **Unreal (Blueprints)**, with projects exploring areas like:
- Real-time multiplayer using Photon
- AI learning / procedural driving
- Combat-focused platformers and shooters
- 2D / 3D Games

## Let’s Connect
Feel free to reach out or check out more of my work. I'm always happy to talk games, code, and design.
